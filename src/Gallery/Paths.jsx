The lighter one is inhabited by human beings who have completely transformed their region into a complex of houses, trees and roads. The darker tetrahedron has, of course, remained in its natural state, with rocks on which plants and prehistoric animals are living. The two bodies fit together to make a whole but they have no knowledge of each other.”-Escher",
