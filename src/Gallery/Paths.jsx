In this series, Escher makes the impossible seem plausible and visible through a remarkably logical construction. “Two regular tetrahedrons that merge into one another, float through space like a planetoid. The lighter one is inhabited by human beings who have completely transformed their region into a complex of houses, trees and roads. The darker tetrahedron has, of course, remained in its natural state, with rocks on which plants and prehistoric animals are living. The two bodies fit together to make a whole but they have no knowledge of each other.”-Escher",

Escher saw the world as a continuous struggle between these extremes and felt his role as an artist was to demonstrate that order, though sometimes seemingly distant, is an inherent part of our world. It is therefore striking that there exists a print where unrest takes center stage, focusing more on conflict than peace. ",
